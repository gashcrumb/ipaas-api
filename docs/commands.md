### Hot Module Replacement
Webpack allows you to swap out modules dynamically during runtime by adding an HMR to your bundle during build time. It runs inside of your app and tracks your modules for changes, with consideration of their dependencies. To read more about Webpack's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature, click [here](http://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html). It can be used as a replacement for LiveReload and has a wide variety of features.
